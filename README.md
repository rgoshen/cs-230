This repo is made for Module 8 in Operating Platforms.

For this project, I worked with a fictional client, The Gaming Room, to design a scalable, web-based version of their mobile game Draw It or Lose It. Their main requirement was to expand their existing Android game to a browser-accessible platform while maintaining a single active game instance, multi-team support, unique naming, and strict gameplay flow. What I feel I did particularly well was translating those requirements into a clean, object-oriented architecture. I used inheritance, composition, and especially the Singleton pattern to ensure centralized control over game state, which not only solved technical challenges but also aligned with the user’s gameplay expectations. Working through the design document first gave me a clear foundation to build the code—it helped me think through edge cases, performance constraints, and cross-platform behavior before writing a single line of code. If I were to revise any part of the documentation, I’d probably refine the system architecture section to include more visual elements like deployment diagrams or sequence flows to complement the detailed text. In terms of user needs, I paid close attention to how users would interact across browsers and devices, which influenced design decisions like responsive UI, platform-agnostic rendering, and stateless session handling. Understanding those needs early on was key to creating a flexible design that could grow with the product. Going forward, I’d keep using a similar approach—starting with domain models, identifying design patterns early, and testing design assumptions through iterative refinement. This process gave me confidence in both the technical solution and my ability to communicate it clearly to stakeholders.
